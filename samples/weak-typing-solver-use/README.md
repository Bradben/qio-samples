# Python SDK Basic Sample

This sample demonstrates the ability to instantiate Azure Quantum optimization solvers without strongly typed classes. This enable in particular access to solvers that may not be available in the QDK yet.

## Prerequisites

To run this sample, please ensure you have [created an Azure Quantum Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/how-to-create-quantum-workspaces-with-the-azure-portal), and followed the [installation steps for the Python SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/how-to-use-the-python-sdk).

## Running the sample

To run the sample, run:

```bash
python weak-typing-solver-use.py
```
