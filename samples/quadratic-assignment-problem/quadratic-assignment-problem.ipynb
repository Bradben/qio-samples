    "# Quadratic Assignment Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is an NP-hard problem involving the assignment of facilities onto different locations. As quoted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_assignment_problem): \n",
    "\n",
    "*There are a set of **n facilities** and a set of **n locations**. For each pair of locations, a distance is specified and for each pair of facilities a weight or flow is specified (e.g., the amount of supplies transported between the two facilities). The problem is to assign all facilities to different locations with the goal of minimizing the sum of the distances multiplied by the corresponding flows.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Problem\n",
    "Consider the following small example with 3 locations $\\{l_{0}, l_{1}, l_{2}\\}$ and 3 facilities $\\{f_{0} = school,  f_{1} = playground,  f_{2} = hospital \\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are town planner deciding where to put these facilities in the town. We can assign one facility to each location on the map. The connection between each location represents the time taken to travel between the locations.   \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](media/qap_map1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make this decision, we also need to know the expected \"throughput\" (i.e. persons travelling) between each facility. Suppose we are given the expected number of people travelling between facilities:\n",
    "\n",

    "|School|0|100|0|\n",
    "|Playground|100|0|5|\n",
    "|Hospital|0|5|0|\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the expected persons travelling between facilities is symmetrical (although it may not be in another problem). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Assignment Configuration\n",
    "We want to place the facilities such that the overall expected travel time (cost) is minimized. An example of a configuration (not necessarily optimal) can be:\n",
    "$\\{school: 2, playground: 1, hospital: 0\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this configuration, the total cost becomes 0\\*20 + 5\\*2 + 100\\*14 = 1410\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal Configuration\n",
    "Since the problem is small, we can see that the optimal assignment is $\\{school: 0, playground: 1, hospital: 2\\}$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This results in a total cost of 100\\*2 + 0\\*20 + 5\\*14 = 270\n",

    "\n",
    "The quadratic assignment problem is not natively an unconstrained binary problem. In order to convert this to QUBO form, we need to define an encoding strategy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Definition\n",
    "One way to do this is to define the following binary variable $x_{i,j}$ that represents whether facility $i$ is assigned to location $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the above case of 3 facilities and 3 locations, we have the following 9 binary variables:\n",

    "|Location 2|$x_{0,2}$|$x_{1,2}$|$x_{2,2}$|\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x_{i,j}$ is 1 if assigned, 0 if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This formulation assumes a symmetric flow between different locations and different facilities. \n",
    "- The number of binary variables increases quadratically with the original number of locations and facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function and Coefficient Definition\n",
    "Recall that we have 2 matrices that define the neighbouring flows between locations (t = time to travel) and facilities (p = persons travelling). \n",

    "|Hospital|0|5|0| |**Location 2**|20|14|0|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression for the total \"cost\" of the system (in this case total travel time) can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Minimize \\quad Cost = \\sum_{i,j,k!=i,l!=j} p_{i,k} \\cdot t_{j,l} \\cdot x_{i,j}\\cdot x_{k,l}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**  \n",
    "Consider a decision variable $x_{0,0}$ (representing **school** assigned to **location 0**). We want consider its cost contribution when placed next to all other possible assignments that **do not include school and location 0**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 4 variables that fit this criteria are: $x_{1,1},x_{1,2},x_{2,1},x_{2,2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the effect of $x_{0,0}$ and $x_{1,2}$, we multiply the connections between their respective facilities and locations. Here school (facility 0) is placed next to playground (facility 1) which has a 100 weight. The cost between location 0 and 2 is 20. The total weight of this edge is 20\\*100 = 2000. \n",

    "### Penalty terms\n",
    "Penalty terms are additional terms on top of the objective function that represent the constraints. They increase the objective value if a constraint has been violated.
